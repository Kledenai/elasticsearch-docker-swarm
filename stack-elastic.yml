# docker stack deploy -c stack-elastic.yml elastic
#
# The stack creates Elasticsearch cluster consiting of
# - 3 dedicated master nodes in order to keep quorum
# - 4 dedicated data nodes to manage CRUD,
# - 2 coordination node acting like kind of load balancer in multi instance environments
#
#
# Incoming requests to Elasticsearch REST API are managed through a coordination node.
#
# Kibana is deployed in Esnet and Proxy network and exposed via Traefik via HTTPS.
# Please update the access URL to kibana (label section) and add this DNS entry to
# allow LetsEncrypt to generate a certificate.
#
# Make sure that you have 4 nodes with hostnames: node-1, node-2, node-3, node-4 because
# constraints and volume persistence refers to the hostname or update the configuration accordingly.
#
# Make sure to tune your VM to run Elasticsearch cluster by executing on each server:
# sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
# add --default-ulimit memlock=-1 to Dockerd
# You can manage that by executing this command on each server consiting Swarm cluter:
#
# sudo "sed -i '/ExecStart=\/usr\/bin\/dockerd/ s/$/--default-ulimit memlock=-1/' /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/10-machine.conf"
